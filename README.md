Xarray-based tools for meteorological Seasons detection (XSeas) is an AI & ML based set of algorithms that enables the exploration of the meteorological seasons and their expected changes in the 21st century.

XSeas offers:
- A clustering algorithm to define the meteorological seasons in a climate dataset (*currently only tested on ERA5*).
- A perceptron based model to explore the representation of the seasons in different datasets, including projected changes in climate models (*currently only tested on a set of CMIP6 models*).

All the models implemented can be used indepentently. Furthermore, a manager class has been developed to perform a standard analysis in a simplified way.
